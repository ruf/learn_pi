Lesson 1: Why programming?
    Computer has no AI, you are playing with results of other people's programming
    Programming give you the whole control of a computer
    You can resolve many problems via programming
    Programming to create software, share to other people

Lesson 2: Why python?
    Easy to start
    Powerful
    Extensible

Lesson 3: Why Raspberry Pi (RPi)?
    Linux based, full functional small PC
    TUI is enough for studying programming
    Good platform for python
    
Lesson 4: Assemble your RPi
    RPi, keyboard, HDMI-to-DVI cable, Monitor, USB Charger
    8GB SD card for storing OS and data
    Connect and poweron

Lesson 5: Before programming
    poweron / poweroff
    login / logout
    switch VT consoles // ALT-Fx
    cd, pwd, mkdir, rmdir, rm, ls -l, w
    nano  // print("Hello, David!")
    Break with ^C / Exit with ^D
    
Lesson 6: Using python
    python console / ^D exit
    1 + 2 + 3, (3 + 4) * 5
    
Lesson 7: Typeof
    int, str, float, bool
    int/float: + - * / ()
    str: "" '' +
    bool: > < == !=
    
Lesson 8: Variable
    X = Y
    X = X + 1
    S = S1 + " " + S2
    
Lesson 9: Function
    print(1)
    name = raw_input("Name? ")
    choice = input("1, 2 or 3? ")
    
Lesson 10: Simplest python program
    name = raw_input("What is you name? ")
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
    nano, ^X, Y, hello.py
    python hello.py
